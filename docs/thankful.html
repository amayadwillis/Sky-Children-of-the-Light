I think the only people I knew at this time was Ala'a, Howl, and Fiyu. I was really happy to be involved in this and it was a great chance to meet new people. I can't remember who some of the other people were but I know this was the first time I'd interacted with Assad."</figcaption>

            First of all, I looked cute even when I was a moth 😂
            I'm thankful for Loli, without her I would never know about this game.. She introduced me to the game, some of you know her and some not, she was my friend from 5 years, or maybe 6 now! And maybe I lost her now, because also of sky I think..
            But still I love her and I will always remember her and pray to her. And I will stay thankful for her that I know all of you now guys.
            My favorite friends are: Amaya, Howl, and Assad.
            First Amaya, I still remember when I was a moth I liked porting to you a lot, because you were so kind with me. Even your name that tgc put for you was Avit, and I kept knowing you as Avit for a really long time, till we opened chat and we started talking. I like to fly with u, I like to spend time with u, I love your character, and I'm thankful for you because I learnt lots of things from u, like how to deal with some of the things in my life and how to face it, you added something really special in me, and I love you a lot!
            Howl, the friend who I talk to every day, I would feel weird if I didn't hear your voice everyday, I enjoy our conversations together, and the things that we talk about, its like we gonna save the world😂, I like your wisdom, and how you act with others, and how you think. I like how you really know what to do and what you really need from this world, and how you are respecting my friends, and the people that I care about, im really thankful for you for all of that, and for sure how you can let me feel better in my worst times, a call from you is enough for me to feel better. I love you so much!
            Now Assad, Rengukoooo, I like how you find nicknames for everyone, and how you love to spend time with the people you love, and how you try your best if I was in a bad mood, I think if you were my real brother, you will be annoying 😂, but still you will be lovely. I love when you call me Nezuko, or Lolo, both of them are very nice from you! Love you boiiii!!"</figcaption>

            Those pictures for me, Loli, Assad, Howl, Fiyu, Amaya, im not sure who is the last one, but this cape was my first cape when I was a moth, and almost all of you wear normal pants so you can match with me since I had nothing yet, and I remember Loli dancing with us, we had a really nice time together, lovee youuuu❤"</figcaption>

        <img src="images/thankfulAmaya3.JPG" height="300" width="550"><figcaption>Amaya: "I am thankful for lovely Howl, I am forever thankful that I met you. I really appreciate your friendship and how caring and loving you are, you truly feel like an older sister (sometimes even like a motherly figure) to me and it means a lot. We've gone thru some tough things together and even when I was afraid you wouldn't want to be friends anymore you never even let that thought cross your mind. You are amazing and supportive and I think everyone really needs to have a Howl in their life ❤"</figcaption>

I don't remember who offered the candle first... But looking back it was a wonderful moment in my life to meet you. I have treasured so many moments with you. I feel so confident in our friendship because we have gone thru so many good things and bad things together and our friendship has withstood all those tests. You are such a dear friend and I love you alot. You mean the world to me ❤️"</figcaption>

I met Loli first when she was lost in the fire trial and I helped her find her way out. She introduced me to you and at first you were Alaa #2 😜... But quickly.. sooo quickly I learned to love you. Now I look back and think of the times I have laughed with you, cried with you, prayed for you, and treasured every moment talking on the phone. Now if a few hours goes by without hearing your voice or seeing what is happening in your life it makes me miss you. You became a sister to me or maybe even a daughter.. I just know u feel like my family. You know what makes me happy, my deepest sorrows and even the insecurities I try to hide from the world. I love you so much and I look forward to growing old with you as my friend. ❤️"</figcaption>

I can't even start to describe how grateful I am that you are in my life. You are the little brother I never had. My confidant, my biggest supporter, my protector. You were my third close friend in the game from around a year ago.   I remember only playing with u when Kyte was around but you never wanted to accept my candle for the longest time 🤣 I remember the day Kyte made you take it cause she bugged u about it and was like... Just take it Assad. 🤣 And I remember thinking it was funny. But.. you know, that one day I was sitting in prairie just enjoying the view and you came and talked with me for like 2 hours. I started to see who you were and slowly I starting learning to love you. I think of your future and I smile and pray. I want so many good things for you. I treasure every moment we spend together. I'm grateful everyone morning to wake up to see "good morning Sistaaaaaa" and to end every day falling asleep talking to you. I love you so much 🥰 I trust you and I like you."</figcaption>

            @🍪Beescuit🐝 Beeeeeeee... Oh my friend I am so grateful for you. You are the most sweet loyal friend. You may not realize it but you helped me thru some of my darkest times with your music and companionship. I remember a time I felt so broken and the deepest grief had come on me from a family situation... You sat with me for over an hour and played music and you wouldn't leave even when friends came asking you to go play. Even tho my character was afk I was listening and your friendship gave me strength to sit up and shake it off and say it's going to be ok. I just love you so much!!! I love how you get a little hyper and honk like a madwoman.. I love all the hugs... I love the crazy messes when you decide to take a group to the moon the slow way 🤣.. I have loved getting to know you and I really think you are an amazing young woman. I treasure your friendship ❤ I love you Beescuit"</figcaption>

I remember I kept hearing about this player named Thoth. I kept hearing what a fun guy he was.. so I really wanted to meet him. Then one day I was talking with Daisy and met you. This picture was from our first conversation. I was having so much fun goofing off with you and remember telling Lolo... You have to meet Mercury. I still remember a day or two later when you and Lolo were at home with me and she said your name Thoth... And I was like where is heeeee..... I was so shocked to find out you and Thoth were the same 😂😂😂. But you know, over time as I have gotten to know you it has been fun to hang out with you (its always a mess 😂), and I have treasured all the times we have conversations about silly things or even important things in life. You give me advice which always makes me consider carefully what I'm thinking and feeling. I really appreciate your brotherly advice and kindness. Mercury, I hope so many good things for you and I pray for you regularly. I wish you so much happiness every day and a bright and joyful future. I love you alot and I'm so grateful you are in my life. 💗"</figcaption>
